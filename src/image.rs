/// This is the structure of the image that will be created.
///
/// > Use the `new` function to get started.
///
/// It is important to remember that the order in which elements are added to the image defines which
/// element goes on top of which. For example, adding text that starts at point 0,0 and then adding a
/// rectangle that also starts at the same point will cause the rectangle to cover the text. However,
/// by reversing the order and adding the rectangle first, it will be placed underneath the text. It
/// is essential to keep this order in mind when creating images with multiple elements to ensure that
/// the elements are in the desired order.
/// ## Examples
/// ```rust
/// # use image_builder::Image;
/// # use image_builder::Rect;
/// # use image_builder::Text;
/// # use image_builder::colors;
/// let mut image = Image::new(500, 500, colors::WHITE);
/// image.add_text(Text::new("Image Builder"));
/// image.add_rect(Rect::new().size(200, 200)); // This rectangle covers the text.
/// ```

/// # use image_builder::Image;
/// # use image_builder::Rect;
/// # use image_builder::Text;
/// # use image_builder::colors;
/// let mut image = Image::new(500, 500, colors::WHITE);
/// image.add_rect(Rect::new().size(200, 200)); // This rectangle is in the background of the text.
/// image.add_text(Text::new("Image Builder"));
